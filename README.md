# ZFS helpers

This is to keep a backup of some some helper scripts I wrote for my very special ZFS needs.

> These scripts are meant to be helpful for me and only me.  If they help you, be happy.

To see what it is, please have a look into the scripts.

> I usually document for my own sake only.

Note that these scripts very likely need small adaption to be useful for you.

> For example, my local ZFS pool is named `/zfs/`
>
> I am probably not very creative when it comes to naming things because I like it to be straight and self explaining.
